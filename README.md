# Vibean
A project for the Electronic and Mobile Business class at the Faculty of Computer and Information Science at Ljubljana University.
The project is mostly written in Dart / Flutter and is a simple app that connects your Youtube account with the app. After you are logged in, it is possible to download the songs you liked on your Youtube profile directly to your phone through the app.
